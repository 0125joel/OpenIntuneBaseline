# OpenIntuneBaseline - MacOS

## Work In Progress!
> [!NOTE]
> This is **not** "production-ready". Please use a test environment where possible, or extreme caution in a production tenant.

## Importing
Thank you for your interest in testing! For now, and unlike the Windows baseline, I'm providing the MacOS policies as native Intune JSON exports! 

Simply grab the files from the MACOS/NativeImport folder, and import them directly by hitting Create > Import Policy in the Devices > MacOS > Configuration page!

## Issues/Feedback
While policies are marked as "v1.0", consider this a beta release. I've noted some initial issues I've seen in testing in [KNOWNISSUES.md](KNOWNISSUES.md)

Feedback is **SO** important, so I have created a new MacOS Beta Feedback discussion channel here: https://github.com/SkipToTheEndpoint/OpenIntuneBaseline/discussions/categories/macos

Please provide feedback, issues, or suggestions there.
